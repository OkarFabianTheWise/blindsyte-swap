### Project Overview  

We aim to develop a privacy-focused swap platform by leveraging **zk-SNARKs** to ensure transaction confidentiality. Additionally, we will integrate liquidity pools from external exchanges to enhance trading efficiency while concurrently raising our own liquidity.  

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is projected to be completed within **eight weeks**, following the structured timeline below.  


### **Development Timeline**  

#### **Week 1: Planning & Architecture**  
- Develop an **idea skeleton map** outlining core functionalities.  
- Design the **architectural diagram** to define system components and interactions.  

#### **Week 2: Program Structure Definition**  
- Outline the **program and smart contract structure** to guide development.  

#### **Week 3: Smart Contract & UI Development**  
- Begin **smart contract development**, including account structures.  
- Initiate **UI design** to align with functional requirements.  

#### **Week 4: ZK-SNARKs Integration**  
- Implement **zk-SNARKs** for transaction privacy within the program.  

#### **Week 5: Testing & UI Refinement**  
- Conduct an initial **smoke test** for the zk-SNARKs integration.  
- Review and refine the **UI design** for usability.  

#### **Week 6: UI & Backend Integration**  
- Integrate the **UI with the smart contract** for seamless interaction.  

#### **Week 7: Testnet Deployment**  
- Continue **UI and backend integration** refinements.  
- Deploy the **MVP on the testnet** for early-stage testing.  

#### **Week 8: Final Testing & Audits**  
- Conduct a **comprehensive quality assessment** with the QA team.  
- Perform **smart contract and security audits** to ensure robustness.
